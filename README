ANGRYBIRDS AI AGENT FRAMEWORK
Copyright Â© 2013, XiaoYu (Gary) Ge, Stephen Gould, Jochen Renz, Sahan Abeyasinghe, Jim Keys, Kar-Wai Lim, Zain Mubashir, Andrew Wang, Peng Zhang. All rights reserved.
This software contains a framework for developing AI agents capable of
playing Angry Birds. The framework is composed of a javascript plugin
for the Chrome web browser and Java client/server code for interfacing
to the game and implementing the AI stategy. A sample agent is provided.

* A detailed documentation can be found under the doc folder


* Installation Instructions for Chrome Extension ----------------------

  1. Open Chrome
  2. Go to: chrome://chrome/extensions/
  3. Click the 'Developer mode' check box
  4. Click the 'Load unpacked extension...' button
  5. Browse for the 'plugin' folder (contains the 'manifest.json' file)

  NOTE: if the screenshots are coming out as transparent PNG files do the following:
    1. Open Chrome
    2. Go to: chrome://flags/
    3. Find the option 'Disable WebGL' and enable it (i.e., enable the disabling of WebGL)


* Setting the CLASSPATH -----------------------------------------------

  Java uses the CLASSPATH variable to determine where to find
  additional software packages. The exact mechanism for setting the
  CLASSPATH depends on the operating system (Windows, Linux or Mac),
  e.g., use "export CLASSPATH=..." under the bash shell in Linux. The
  CLASSPATH can also be set on the command line using the -cp flag.
  For the AngryBirds AI Framework you will need to include the
  following in the CLASSPATH:

    external/WebSocket.jar:external/json-simple-1.1.1.jar:external/commons-codec-1.7.jar:external/Jama-1.0.2.jar:src:.

  where the directories are relative to the location where you have
  installed the code.
 
* Compile using ANT (1.7 or above) ------------------------------------------------
  You can use ANT to compile the source codes via command line. Ant is a Java library and command-line tool whose mission is to drive processes described in build files as targets and extension points dependent upon each other. For more information, please refer to  http://ant.apache.org/

  You can download ANT from http://ant.apache.org/manualdownload.cgi  and please note ANT 1.7 or above required

  To compile the source codes, go to the software directory, and use command:  ant compile
 
  To generate an executable file:  ant jar
  

* Running the Sample Agent --------------------------------------------

  java -jar ab1.0.jar -na                // run the agent from level 1
   
  java -jar ab1.0.jar -na [0-21]       // run the agent from the specified level.

  java -jar ab1.0.jar -na [0-21] -showSeg     // run the agent with the real-time vision output

  java -jar ab1.0.jar -showSeg        // show the real-time image segementation

  java -jar ab1.0.jar -showTraj        // show the real-time trajectory prediction

  java -jar ab1.0.jar -recordImg [directory] // save the current game image to the specified directory
